# üöÄ Backend Interview - Quick Reference Card

## ‚ö° **YOUR PROJECT ELEVATOR PITCH** (2 minutes)

```
"I built a full-stack video platform backend using Node.js and Express that demonstrates
enterprise-level architecture. It features complete user authentication with JWT,
file upload to Cloudinary, CRUD operations for videos/comments/playlists, and
comprehensive testing. The project follows MVC architecture with proper security,
validation, and error handling."
```

## üî• **TOP 5 CONCEPTS TO KNOW**

### **1. REST API**

- GET (read), POST (create), PUT/PATCH (update), DELETE (remove)
- Stateless communication using HTTP methods

### **2. JWT Authentication**

- User logs in ‚Üí gets token ‚Üí includes in future requests ‚Üí server verifies

### **3. Middleware**

- Functions that run between request and response (like security checkpoints)
- Examples: authentication, validation, error handling

### **4. Express.js**

- Web framework for Node.js that handles routing, middleware, HTTP requests

### **5. Database Relationships**

- MongoDB with Mongoose for schema validation and relationships

## üéØ **YOUR TECH STACK (Memorize This)**

- **Runtime**: Node.js 20+
- **Framework**: Express.js 5.x
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT (jsonwebtoken)
- **File Storage**: Cloudinary
- **Validation**: Zod schemas
- **Testing**: Jest + Supertest
- **Security**: bcrypt, CORS, rate limiting

## üõ°Ô∏è **SECURITY FEATURES YOU IMPLEMENTED**

- JWT authentication with access/refresh tokens
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes)
- CORS configuration
- Error handling that doesn't expose internals

## üìä **YOUR PROJECT NUMBERS**

- **7 Passing Tests** (health check, authentication, validation, error handling)
- **9 API Controllers** (user, video, comment, like, playlist, subscription, etc.)
- **Multiple Database Models** (User, Video, Comment, Like, Playlist, Subscription)
- **Professional Architecture** (MVC pattern with separated concerns)

## üé§ **COMMON QUESTION ANSWERS**

### **"What is a backend?"**

```
"Server-side application that handles business logic, database operations,
and provides data to frontend through HTTP APIs. Like the engine of a car -
users don't see it, but it powers everything."
```

### **"How do you handle errors?"**

```
"Centralized error middleware that catches all errors and returns consistent
JSON responses. Custom error classes for different types. User-friendly
messages without exposing system internals."
```

### **"How do you test APIs?"**

```
"Jest with Supertest for HTTP endpoint testing. Tests run without real servers,
cover health checks, authentication, validation, and error scenarios.
Fast and reliable."
```

### **"Authentication vs Authorization?"**

```
"Authentication = WHO you are (login with credentials)
Authorization = WHAT you can do (permissions to access/modify resources)
Example: JWT verifies identity, middleware checks if user owns video before deletion"
```

## üöÄ **CONFIDENCE STATEMENTS**

### **When Asked About Experience:**

```
"I may be new to professional development, but I've built a production-ready
backend that demonstrates solid understanding of core concepts and industry
best practices. I'm eager to learn and contribute to real-world projects."
```

### **When Discussing Challenges:**

```
"Building this project taught me about production concerns like security,
testing, error handling, and scalable architecture. Each challenge made me
a better developer."
```

## üí° **QUESTIONS TO ASK THEM**

- "What does your current backend architecture look like?"
- "What are the biggest technical challenges your team faces?"
- "How do you handle deployment and scaling?"
- "What learning opportunities exist for junior developers?"
- "What would a typical day look like in this role?"
